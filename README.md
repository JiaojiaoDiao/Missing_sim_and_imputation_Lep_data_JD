# Missing_sim_and_imputation_Lep_data_JD
This revised R script performs trait imputation and uncertainty assessment for Lepidoptera species using the original, non-dummy-encoded trait data. It evaluates three imputation methods (TaxPaint, MissForest with and without phylogeny) under multiple random seeds using Macro-F1 scores to quantify categorical uncertainty.
